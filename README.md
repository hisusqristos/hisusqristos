Dear visitor,

This space is one of great joy, where challenges are faced with the courage of a warrior tiger-girl, a *"wartigirl"*. </br>
I keep my repositories public as a commitment to transparency, knowing they are full of flaws and unfinished ideas. </br>
But each one reflects my path, and i welcome you to see it as it is.
