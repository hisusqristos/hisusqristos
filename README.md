This space is one of authenticity, where challenges are faced with the courage of a gallant girl-tiger-knight, a 'tigirlight'. I keep my repositories public as a commitment to transparency, knowing they are full of flaws and unfinished ideas. But each one reflects my path, and i welcome you to see it as it is.
